File 1: <br />
#Name: 20x42b.scad & 20x42b.stl <br />
#Description: This is a CAD and rendered STL file which with a 3D printer produces a solid non-functioning replica of the 20x42 belted ammunition used in the [Neopup PAW-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopup_PAW-20) weapon produced by Denel PMP in South Africa. I made this because I think its a [very cool firearm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHbqHx3TLBE), and I wanted to print myself a paperweight. You will need to sand the nose down a little to give it a proper squared off round nose.
