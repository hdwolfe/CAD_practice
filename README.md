File 1: 20x42b.scad & 20x42b.stl <br />
<blockquote>
This is a scad (CAD) and rendered STL file which with a 3D printer produces a solid non-functioning replica of the 20x42 belted ammunition used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopup_PAW-20">Neopup PAW-20</a> weapon produced by Denel PMP in South Africa. I did photogrammetry using publicly available images to estimate all the dimensions, so it should be about as close to true as anyone can get without having the schematics. I made this because I think its a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHbqHx3TLBE">very cool firearm<a/>, and I wanted to print myself a paperweight. You will need to 1) lightly sand down the nose to give it a proper squared-off round shape and 2) lightly sand the faint seam where the rounded head meets the ridge of the cone.
