File 1: 20x42b.scad & 20x42b.stl <br />
<blockquote>
This is a scad (CAD) and rendered STL file which with a 3D printer produces a solid non-functioning replica of the 20x42 belted ammunition used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopup_PAW-20">Neopup PAW-20</a> weapon produced by Denel PMP in South Africa. I did photogrammetry using publicly available images to estimate all the dimensions, so it should be about as close to true as anyone can get without having the schematics. The only detail left out was the primer, if you wish, you will need to watch the forgotten weapons video in the next link to try and guess & carve that yourself. I made this because I think its a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHbqHx3TLBE">very cool firearm<a/>, and I wanted to print myself a paperweight. After printing you will need to 1) lightly sand down the nose to give it a proper squared-off round shape and 2) lightly sand the faint seam where the rounded head meets the ridge of the cone (i.e. at body_length in scad file, AKA 103.1029mm from the base).
